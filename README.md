# Kodi GeForceNOW

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ZoltePudeleczko/Kodi-GeForceNOW.svg)](https://github.com/ZoltePudeleczko/Kodi-GeForceNOW/releases)

As simple as possible Kodi addon for launching NVIDIA GeForce NOW app

Build in mind with Kodi 21.2 (Omega) - works perfectly on this version, should also work on newer ones

## Keep in mind

- You have to have official NVIDIA GeForce NOW app installed - you can get it [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/download/)
- Currently only supports Windows
- If you have problems with using the extension on older Kodi versions please older addon versions in [releases](https://github.com/ZoltePudeleczko/Kodi-GeForceNOW/releases)

## What's next?

If I'll have the time and motivation I'll try to add support for other platforms (Linux, MacOS)
