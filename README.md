A simple and effective Kodi addon for launching the NVIDIA GeForce NOW app.

Updated and fully compatible with Kodi 21.2 (Omega).

## Which version should I get?

The version you need depends on your Kodi version, as the Python library version
changes with some Kodi updates.

- You must have the NVIDIA GeForce NOW app installed
  - For Windows you can download it from the official Nvidia website:
    [nvidia.com GeForce NOW download][nvidia_download]
  - For Linux, as there is no official app yet, you need to install the
    unofficial app developed by [@hmlendea][hmlendea] ([gfn-electron][gfn_electron])
- You can override the launcher by enabling `Use custom executable` in the addon
  settings
